To run the program on JUPYTER:
1.upload both the program and the csv files to the JUPYTER.
2.load the program in a notebook and run.

For KNN:
1.Change the value in the "for x in range("the number of features of the dataset") in line 21.
2. A path should be provided for the dataset in the main function line 92.
2. The prompt will wait for the user input for value of k.
3. Promo will ask for the value of the feature to be predicted.(An integer value of the feature index is to given here.)


For Nbayes:
1.Change the path at line 6 and line 7. Provide the dataset path at line 6 for _dataset and provide path to .names file at line 7 for _attributes. 
2. The program will be able to provide the output on its own along with the accuracy.
